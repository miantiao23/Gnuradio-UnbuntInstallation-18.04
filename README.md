# Gnuradio-UnbuntInstallation-18.04
I updated the ubuntu system from 16.04(LST) to 18.04 (LST). But it occured a issue that the Gnuradio software cannot use in updated environment. 


I tried to used the original version from GNU raido official website. However it showed that the support for ubuntu 18.04 is not anymore. 
I tried to updated the installation from the GNU radio official installation guide. It didn't work. A lot of dependencies are missing. 
The most impressive dependency is 'thrift', I tried many ways to install this module, it still could not work anymore. 
Many guide installations are also not good for beginners, just like me.
